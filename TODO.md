# Todo List

- Scroll Pagination to limit product load 
    - **Why** - This will not load entire list on DOM and we can integrate lazy loading of products to a level.  
- viewport loading to reduce DOM load
    - **Why** - Using this approach, we can light down our DOM and based on current viewport we will show all required info to user.
- Additional work to improve Accessibility
- E2E testing (e.g cypress or testcafe)
- We have few hardcoded message and label so in case of localization, I will prefer to crease some locale files and use react-intl package for dymanic localization message.
- Add to cart logic is incomplete, I was planning to construct one object in context but due to other schedules time won't allow me to do so
